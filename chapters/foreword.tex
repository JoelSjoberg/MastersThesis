\title{Foreword}

This thesis would not have been possible without the supervision and support of Luigia Petre, whose patient attitude and rigorous feedback has provided me great inspiration in writing and expanding each chapter. I would also like to thank Ion Petre, who generously allowed me to take part in the project this thesis covers. His enthusiasm and understanding has been a great source of inspiration to me and my fellow peers as we have delved into our studies. I thank my parents and extended family, who all have suffered through lengthy discussions and explanations about this project and other jargon related to my area of study. And to my fellow peers, whom I have had the exceptional and delightful privilege of meeting. The courses and lectures have given us the materials, but I learned everything by discussing and working with you. This thesis, not to mention my degree, would not have been possible without you. I hope this knowledge we have achieved, along with our experiences, will help us make the world a better place, Thank you all.
