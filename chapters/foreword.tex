\title{Foreword}

This thesis would not have been possible without the supervision and support of Luigia Petre, whose patient attitude and rigorous feedback has provided me great inspiration in writing and expanding each chapter. I would also like to thank Ion Petre, who generously allowed me to take part in the project this thesis covers, and for his encouragement and support. I thank my parents and extended family, who all have suffered through lengthy discussions and explanations about this project and other jargon related to my area of study. And my fellow peers, whom I have had the exceptional and delightful privilege of meeting. Our long discussions about our studies have fueled my enthusiasm since my first year as a student, and will continue to do so for years to come. I would especially like to thank Patric Gustafsson, whose hard work and dedication is inspiring. His brilliant thesis motivated me to finish this one, and and his support helped me power through to the end. This thesis, not to mention my degree, would not have been possible without all of you.
